# Bare Metal (VM) vs. Container

We want to test the difference between:

 - building an application on bare metal
 - building with a container on the same instruction set (the instance)
 - building with a container on a different instruction set (my host)
 - for each container build:
   - running on bare metal
   - running with singularity
   - running with docker
   - running with podman

 - [docker](docker): includes Docker builds for several applications intended for Google Cloud c2d instances
